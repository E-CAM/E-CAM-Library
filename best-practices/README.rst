This document is not meant to be a set of rules, but a set of guidelines that have been formed on the basis of
hard-earned experience. We welcome contributions from anyone, anywhere on any of the topics discussed here. The
rendered version of this repository can be found at
http://scientific-software-best-practices.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html.

It began as a starting point for guidelines for contributions to the Extended Software Development Workshops (ESDWs)
of E-CAM but can be considered as a collection of best practice advice for scientific software development.
The scope of these workshops was always expected to vary significantly depending on the research area, as well as over
the project lifetime. For this reason the document itself is quite broad and (in many places) introductory in nature.

Until there are a lot of different contributors it should probably be considered more of a blog than a good
representation of the spectrum of scientific software developers. For many communities there may well be better guidelines
to be found elsewhere.
