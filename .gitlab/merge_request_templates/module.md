*Checklist when the module is first submitted*

- [ ] Have the relevant labels been added to the MR
- [ ] If submitted on someone elses behalf, has the software author been referenced (if they have a GitLab account) 

*Checklist when module is no longer "WIP"*

- [ ] Is the module documentation sufficiently detailed?
- [ ] Is it mergeable? (i.e., there should be no merge conflicts)
- [ ] Are the build instructions sufficient - source code locations, build instructions, etc.? (If not the MR should be updated)
- [ ] Did it pass the tests that were described? (Are there unit/regression tests? Do they pass?)
- [ ] Are the tests sufficient?
- [ ] If the module introduces new functionality, is it tested? (Unit/regression tests?)
- [ ] Is the associated source code well formatted? (typos, line length, brackets,...it should be consistent with existing source)
- [ ] Is all new source code sufficiently documented? (functions, their arguments,...)
- [ ] Is there a description of any applications the module has? (This is a hard requirement for E-CAM PDRAs)

*After Merging*
- [ ] Add a link to the final result on https://e-cam.readthedocs.io
