..  In the next line you have the name of how this module will be referenced in the main documentation (which you  can
    reference, in this case, as ":ref:`example`"). You *MUST* change the reference below from "example" to something
    unique otherwise you will cause cross-referencing errors. The reference must come right before the heading for the
    reference to work (so don't insert a comment between).

..  Let's add a local table of contents to help people navigate the page

.. contents:: :local:

..  Add an abstract for a *general* audience here. Write a few lines that explains the "helicopter view" of why you are
    creating this module. For example, you might say that "This module is a stepping stone to incorporating XXXX effects
    into YYYY process, which in turn should allow ZZZZ to be simulated. If successful, this could make it possible to
    produce compound AAAA while avoiding expensive process BBBB and CCCC."

This module adds tools to the *n2p2* package which allow to assess the quality of
atomic environment descriptors. This is particularly useful when designing a
neural network potential based coarse-grained model (NNP-CG).

.. The E-CAM library is purely a set of documentation that describes software development efforts related to the
   project. A *module* for E-CAM is the documentation of the single development of effort associated to the project.In
   that sense, a module does not directly contain source code but instead contains links to source code, typically
   stored elsewhere. Each module references the source code changes to which it directly applies (usually via a URL),
   and provides detailed information on the relevant *application* for the changes as well as how to build and test the
   associated software.

.. The original source of this page (:download:`readme.rst`) contains lots of additional comments to help you create
   your documentation *module* so please use this as a starting point. We use Sphinx_ (which in turn uses ReST_) to
   create this documentation. You are free to add any level of complexity you wish (within the bounds of what Sphinx_
   and ReST_ can do). More general instructions for making your contribution can be found in ":ref:`contributing`".

.. Remember that for a module to be accepted into the E-CAM repository, your source code changes in the target
   application must pass a number of acceptance criteria:
   * Style *(use meaningful variable names, no global variables,...)*
   
   * Source code documentation *(each function should be documented with each argument explained)*
   
   * Tests *(everything you add should have either unit or regression tests)*
   
   * Performance *(If what you introduce has a significant computational load you should make some performance
     optimisation effort using an appropriate tool. You should be able to verify that your changes have not
     introduced unexpected performance penalties, are threadsafe if needed,...)*

Purpose of Module
_________________

Creating a coarse-grained (CG) model from the full description of a system is a
two-step process: (1) selecting a reduced set of degrees of freedom and (2)
defining interactions depending on these coarse-grained variables. For example,
in a common coarse-graining approach for molecular systems the atomistic picture
is replaced by a simpler description with CG particles sitting at the
center-of-mass coordinates of the actual molecules. The corresponding
interactions between CG sites can be modelled with empirical force fields but
also, as has been recently shown in [1]_ and [2]_, with machine learning
potentials. To simplify the construction of NNP based coarse-grained models in
*n2p2* this module adds software to estimate the quality of atomic environment
descriptors, which in turn hints on the expected performance of the
coarse-grained description.

The overall goal of the descriptor analysis is to show qualitatively whether
there is a correlation between the raw atomic environment descriptors (and their
derivatives) and the atomic forces. If no or very little correlation can be
found we can assume that the descriptors do not encode enough information to
construct a (free) energy landscape. On the other hand, if "similar" descriptors
correspond to "similar" forces there is a good chance that a machine learning
algorithm is capable of detecting this link and a machine learning potential can
be fitted. In order to find a possible correlation between descriptors and
forces the following approach is used: First, a clustering algorithm (k-means or
HDBSCAN) searches for groups in the high-dimensional descriptor space of all
atoms. Then, for every detected cluster the statistical distribution of the
corresponding atomic forces is compared to the statistics of all remaining
atomic forces. A hypothesis test (Welch's t-test) is applied to decide whether
the link between descriptors and forces is statistically significant. The
percentage of clusters which show a clear link is then an indicator for a good
descriptor-force correlation.

In order to perform the analysis described above *n2p2* was extended by two
software pieces:

1. **A new application based on the C++ libraries:** `nnp-atomenv
   <https://compphysvienna.github.io/n2p2/tools/nnp-atomenv.html>`__

   This application allows to generate files containing the atomic environment
   data required for the cluster analysis.

2. **A new Jupyter notebook with the actual analysis:**
   `analyze-descriptors.ipynb
   <https://compphysvienna.github.io/n2p2/misc/cg_descriptor_analysis.html>`__

   The script depends on common Python libraries (*numpy*, *scipy*,
   *scikit-learn*) and reads in data provided by ``nnp-atomenv``. It then clusters
   the data, performs statistical tests and presents graphical results.


.. Keep the helper text below around in your module by just adding "..  " in front of it, which turns it into a comment

.. Give a brief overview of why the module is/was being created, explaining a little of the scientific background and
   how it fits into the larger picture of what you want to achieve. The overview should be comprehensible to a scientist
   non-expert in the domain area of the software module.
   
   This section should also include the following (where appropriate):
   
   * Who will use the module? in what area(s) and in what context?
   
   * What kind of problems can be solved by the code?
   
   * Are there any real-world applications for it?
   
   * Has the module been interfaced with other packages?
   
   * Was it used in a thesis, a scientific collaboration, or was it cited in a publication?
   
   * If there are published results obtained using this code, describe them briefly in terms readable for non-expert
     users.  If you have few pictures/graphs illustrating the power or utility of the module, please include them
     with corresponding explanatory captions.

.. .. note::
   
     If the module is an ingredient for a more general workflow (e.g. the module was the necessary foundation for later
     code; the module is part of a group of modules that will be used to calculate certain property or have certain
     application, etc.) mention this, and point to the place where you specify the applications of the more general
     workflow (that could be in another module, in another section of this repository, an applicationâ€™s website, etc.).

.. .. note::
   
     If you are a post-doc who works in E-CAM, an obvious application for the module (or for the group of modules that
     this one is part of) is your pilot project. In this case, you could point to the pilot project page on the main
     website (and you must ensure that this module is linked there).

.. If needed you can include latex mathematics like
  :math:`\frac{ \sum_{t=0}^{N}f(t,k) }{N}`
  which won't show up on GitLab/GitHub but will in final online documentation.

.. If you want to add a citation, such as [CIT2009]_, please check the source code to see how this is done. Note that
   citations may get rearranged, e.g., to the bottom of the "page".

.. .. [CIT2009] This is a citation (as often used in journals).

Background Information
______________________

.. Keep the helper text below around in your module by just adding "..  " in front of it, which turns it into a comment

.. If the modifications are to an existing code base (which is typical) then this would be the place to name that
   application. List any relevant urls and explain how to get access to that code. There needs to be enough
   information here so that the person reading knows where to get the source code for the application, what version
   this information is relevant for, whether this requires any additional patches/plugins, etc.

.. Overall, this module is supposed to be self-contained, but linking to specific URLs with more detailed information
   is encouraged. In other words, the reader should not need to do a websearch to understand the context of this module,
   all the links they need should be already in this module.

This module is based on *n2p2*, a C++ code for generation and application of
neural network potentials used in molecular dynamics simulations. The source
code and documentation are located here:

* *n2p2* documentation: http://compphysvienna.github.io/n2p2/
* *n2p2* source code: http://github.com/CompPhysVienna/n2p2


Building and Testing
____________________

.. Keep the helper text below around in your module by just adding "..  " in front of it, which turns it into a comment

.. Provide the build information for the module here and explain how tests are run. This needs to be adequately
   detailed, explaining if necessary any deviations from the normal build procedure of the application (and links to
   information about the normal build process needs to be provided).

The code changes from this module are already merged with the main *n2p2*
repository (see the section below for corresponding pull requests).

.. note::

   By the time of reading these instructions *n2p2* was most likely
   developed further. To recall the state of the software at the time of writing
   these instructions please use these commands:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/CompPhysVienna/n2p2
      cd n2p2
      git checkout 3cfe391377d2792ac29baf8394b3dce712afdad2

To build the new tool ``nnp-atomenv`` the usual `n2p2 build instructions
<https://compphysvienna.github.io/n2p2/topics/build.html>`__ apply:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd src
   make nnp-atomenv -j

The ``analyze-descriptors.ipynb`` Jupyter notebook requires some Python packages
to be installed:

*  numpy
*  scipy
*  matplotlib
*  seaborn
*  scikit-learn
*  hdbscan
*  pickle

Step-by-step instructions on how the descriptor analysis is prepared and
performed is available at `this dedicated documentation page
<https://compphysvienna.github.io/n2p2/misc/cg_descriptor_analysis.html>`__

Regression testing is used in *n2p2* automatically for each commit to the main
repository. This module also adds the corresponding tests for the
``nnp-atomenv`` tool in ``test/cpp/``. The build log showing the correct run of
tests is available `here <https://travis-ci.org/github/CompPhysVienna/n2p2/builds/762153549>`__.

Source Code
___________

.. Notice the syntax of a URL reference below `Text <URL>`_ the backticks matter!

.. Here link the source code *that was created for the module*. If you are using Github or GitLab and the `Gitflow
   Workflow <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#gitflow-workflow>`_ you can point to your
   feature branch.  Linking to your pull/merge requests is even better. Otherwise you can link to the explicit commits.
   
   * `Link to a merge request containing my source code changes
     <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/1106>`_
   
   There may be a situation where you cannot do such linking. In this case, I'll go through an example that uses a patch
   file to highlight my source code changes, for that reason I would need to explain what code (including exact version
   information), the source code is for.
   
   You can create a similar patch file by (for example if you are using git for your version control) making your
   changes for the module in a feature branch and then doing something like the following:

.. Don't forget the white space around the "literal block" (a literal block keeps all spacing and is a good way to
   include terminal output, file contents, etc.)

.. ::

..   [adam@mbp2600 example (master)]$ git checkout -b tmpsquash
     Switched to a new branch "tmpsquash"

..   [adam@mbp2600 example (tmpsquash)]$ git merge --squash newlines
     Updating 4d2de39..b6768b2
     Fast forward
     Squash commit -- not updating HEAD
      test.txt |    2 ++
      1 files changed, 2 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)

..   [adam@mbp2600 example (tmpsquash)]$ git commit -a -m "My squashed commits"
     [tmpsquash]: created 75b0a89: "My squashed commits"
      1 files changed, 2 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)

..   [adam@mbp2600 example (tmpsquash)]$ git format-patch master
     0001-My-squashed-commits.patch


.. To include a patch file do something like the following (take a look at the source code of this document to see the
   syntax required to get this):

..  Below I am telling Sphinx that the included file is C code, if possible it will then do syntax highlighting. I can
    even emphasise partiuclar lines (here 2 and 9-11)

.. .. literalinclude:: ./simple.patch
      :language: c
      :emphasize-lines: 2,9-11
      :linenos:


..  I can't highlight the language syntax of a patch though so I have to exclude
    :language: c

.. .. literalinclude:: ./simple.patch
      :emphasize-lines: 2,9-11
      :linenos:

.. If the patch is very long you will probably want to add it as a subpage which can be done as follows

.. .. toctree::
      :glob:
      :maxdepth: 1
   
      patch

..  Remember to change the reference "patch" for something unique in your patch file subpage or you will have
    cross-referencing problems

.. you can reference it with :ref:`patch`

The new functionality introduced by this module is collected in two pull requests:

*  `New tool for symmetry function quality analysis <https://github.com/CompPhysVienna/n2p2/pull/27>`__
*  `Complete coarse-graining/descriptor analysis documentation <https://github.com/CompPhysVienna/n2p2/pull/95>`__

The easiest way to view the source code changes is to use the *Files changed*
tab in the above pull request pages.
