..  In ReStructured Text (ReST) indentation and spacing are very important (it is how ReST knows what to do with your
    document). For ReST to understand what you intend and to render it correctly please to keep the structure of this
    template. Make sure that any time you use ReST syntax (such as for ".. sidebar::" below), it needs to be preceded
    and followed by white space (if you see warnings when this file is built they this is a common origin for problems).


..  Firstly, let's add technical info as a sidebar and allow text below to wrap around it. This list is a work in
    progress, please help us improve it. We use *definition lists* of ReST_ to make this readable.

.. Let's add a local table of contents to help people navigate the page

.. contents:: :local:

..  Add an abstract for a *general* audience here. Write a few lines that
    explains the "helicopter view" of why you are creating this module. For
    example, you might say that "This module is a stepping stone to
    incorporating XXXX effects into YYYY process, which in turn should allow
    ZZZZ to be simulated. If successful, this could make it possible to
    produce compound AAAA while avoiding expensive process BBBB and CCCC."

This module helps the analysis of binding events. It includes tools for
identifying windows of a trajectory when a ligand is bound to substrate, as
well as analyzing the contacts made while bound.

Purpose of Module
_________________

TODO: Add background. Main contributions in this module:

* methods for the user designate different parts of the ligand (analogous to
  residues in a biomolecule; frequently a the contacts with specific parts
  of small molecule/potential will be important.)
* tools for identifying which contacts exist at the same times (are
  correlated) within a trajectory


.. * Who will use the module? in what area(s) and in what context?

.. * What kind of problems can be solved by the code?

.. * Are there any real-world applications for it?

.. * Has the module been interfaced with other packages?

.. * Was it used in a thesis, a scientific collaboration, or was it cited in
..   a publication?

.. * If there are published results obtained using this code, describe them
     briefly in terms readable for non-expert users.  If you have few
     pictures/graphs illustrating the power or utility of the module, please
     include them with corresponding explanatory captions.

.. note::

  If the module is an ingredient for a more general workflow (e.g. the
  module was the necessary foundation for later code; the module is part of
  a group of modules that will be used to calculate certain property or have
  certain application, etc.) mention this, and point to the place where you
  specify the applications of the more general workflow (that could be in
  another module, in another section of this repository, an applicationâ€™s
  website, etc.).

.. note::

  If you are a post-docs who works in E-CAM, an obvious application for the
  module (or for the group of modules that this one is part of) is your
  pilot project. In this case, you could point for the pilot project page on
  the main website (and you must ensure that this module is linked there).


Background Information
______________________

.. Keep the helper text below around in your module by just adding "..  " in front of it, which turns it into a comment

If the modifications are to an existing code base (which is typical) then this would be the place to name that
application. List any relevant urls and explain how to get access to that code. There needs to be enough information
here so that the person reading knows where to get the source code for the application, what version this information is
relevant for, whether this requires any additional patches/plugins, etc.

Overall, this module is supposed to be self-contained, but linking to specific URLs with more detailed information is
encouraged. In other words, the reader should not need to do a websearch to understand the context of this module, all
the links they need should be already in this module.

Building and Testing
____________________

.. Keep the helper text below around in your module by just adding "..  " in front of it, which turns it into a comment

Provide the build information for the module here and explain how tests are run. This needs to be adequately detailed,
explaining if necessary any deviations from the normal build procedure of the application (and links to information
about the normal build process needs to be provided).

Source Code
___________

.. Notice the syntax of a URL reference below `Text <URL>`_ the backticks matter!

Here link the source code *that was created for the module*. If you are using Github or GitLab and the `Gitflow Workflow
<https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#gitflow-workflow>`_ you can point to your feature branch.
Linking to your pull/merge requests is even better. Otherwise you can link to the explicit commits.

* `Link to a merge request containing my source code changes
  <https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/1106>`_

There may be a situation where you cannot do such linking. In this case, I'll go through an example that uses a patch
file to highlight my source code changes, for that reason I would need to explain what code (including exact version
information), the source code is for.

You can create a similar patch file by (for example if you are using git for your version control) making your changes
for the module in a feature branch and then doing something like the following:

..  Don't forget the white space around the "literal block" (a literal block keeps all spacing and is a good way to
    include terminal output, file contents, etc.)

::

  [adam@mbp2600 example (master)]$ git checkout -b tmpsquash
  Switched to a new branch "tmpsquash"

  [adam@mbp2600 example (tmpsquash)]$ git merge --squash newlines

To include a patch file do something like the following (take a look at the source code of this document to see the
syntax required to get this):

..  Below I am telling Sphinx that the included file is C code, if possible it will then do syntax highlighting. I can
    even emphasise partiuclar lines (here 2 and 9-11)

.. literalinclude:: ./simple.patch
   :language: c
   :emphasize-lines: 2,9-11
   :linenos:

If the patch is very long you will probably want to add it as a subpage which can be done as follows

.. toctree::
   :glob:
   :maxdepth: 1

   patch

..  Remember to change the reference "patch" for something unique in your patch file subpage or you will have
    cross-referencing problems

you can reference it with :ref:`patch`

.. Here are the URL references used (which is alternative method to the one described above)
