Purpose of Module
___________________

PANNA-EVAL module evaluates an all to all connected neural network  
to predict atomistic quantities, e.g. total energy and forces of a given crystal structure. 

PANNA-EVAL can be used with other modules of the PANNA project for neural network validation, 
but it can also serve to carry the information of the trianed network to other platforms such as
molecular dynamics code LAMMPS. 

Although PANNA-EVAL does not need the advanced capabilities of the TensorFlow fraework, 
it uses the 'checkpoint' information to automatically test the performance of a network from training data.
