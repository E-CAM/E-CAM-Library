Integration of PSolver in SIESTA and Octopus
############################################

..  contents:: :local:

..  Add an abstract for a *general* audience here. Write a few lines that explains the "helicopter view" of why you are
    creating this module. For example, you might say that "This module is a stepping stone to incorporating XXXX effects
    into YYYY process, which in turn should allow ZZZZ to be simulated. If successful, this could make it possible to
    produce compound AAAA while avoiding expensive process BBBB and CCCC."

A Poisson solver is an efficient tool to determine electromagnetic fields produced by an electric charge distributed in
space. The integration of PSolver into SIESTA and Octopus has opened the way for these software programs to access more
complex physical systems.
The PSolver library allows solving the Poisson equation in much more general ways than using Fourier Transforms.


Purpose of Module
_________________

.. Keep the helper text below around in your module by just adding "..  " in front of it, which turns it into a comment
   Give a brief overview of why the module is/was being created, explaining a little of the scientific background and how
   it fits into the larger picture of what you want to achieve. The overview should be comprehensible to a scientist
   non-expert in the domain area of the software module.

   This section should also include the following (where appropriate):

   * Who will use the module? in what area(s) and in what context?

   * What kind of problems can be solved by the code?

   * Are there any real-world applications for it?

   * Has the module been interfaced with other packages?

   * Was it used in a thesis, a scientific collaboration, or was it cited in a publication?

   * If there are published results obtained using this code, describe them briefly in terms readable for non-expert users.
     If you have few pictures/graphs illustrating the power or utility of the module, please include them with
     corresponding explanatory captions.

The PSolver library solves the Poisson equation using wavelets. With this approximation one can more easily take into account certain boundary conditions such as molecules (no boundaries), wires (periodic along 1 direction) and slabs (periodic along 2 directions). This is in contrast to Fourier transforms which assumes periodic boundary conditions along all lattice vectors. Additionally it allows cavities for different dielectric constants. 

This implementation integrates the PSolver library into the DFT codes SIESTA and Octopus such that they may be used for end-users who require the functionalities.


.. note::

    If the module is an ingredient for a more general workflow (e.g. the module was the necessary foundation for later
    code; the module is part of a group of modules that will be used to calculate certain property or have certain
    application, etc.) mention this, and point to the place where you specify the applications of the more general
    workflow (that could be in another module, in another section of this repository, an applicationâ€™s website, etc.).

.. note::

    If you are a post-doc who works in E-CAM, an obvious application for the module (or for the group of modules that
    this one is part of) is your pilot project. In this case, you could point to the pilot project page on the main
    website (and you must ensure that this module is linked there).


Background Information
______________________

Users of the SIESTA code have always been using the Fourier transforms for solving the Poisson equation. However, a great deal of users are dealing with, in particular, slab systems given the advent of graphene, 2D materials and surface calculations.
This integration allows users to control the boundaries in a very strict way without any approximations.
The latest PSolver library (shipped with BigDFT 1.9.0) will work.

The have been added tests in SIESTA to ensure that everything works.


The OCTOPUS code has various options to solve the Poisson equations. Amongst others were the ISF library,
which is a predecessor of the PSolver library. In the later OCTOPUS versions, an older version of PSolver 
was packaged with the OCTOPUS sources. For the recently released OCTOPUS 10, the interface to PSolver has 
been updated, so that  both the old and the new API of PSolver can be used.
This also prepares OCTOPUS to use the GPU version of PSolver, once it becomes available. The configure scripts of OCTOPUS 
have been adapted to correctly detect and configure an installed PSolver library, and tests using the library have been added
to the OCTOPUS buildbot.





Building and Testing
____________________

To compile SIESTA with PSolver users should add this to their `arch.make`

.. code-block:: make

  LIBS += -L<build-dir>/install/lib -lPSolver-1 -latlab-1 -lfutile-1 -ldicts -lfmalloc-1 -lyaml
  INCFLAGS += -I<build-dir>/install/include
  FPPFLAGS += -DSIESTA__PSOLVER

After building there are two tests, `h2o_psolver` and `si2x1h-psolver` which can be compared with `h2o` and `si2x1h`, respectively. They should be comparable.


In order to compile OCTOPUS with the PSolver library, add the options `--with-psolver-prefix` and `--with-futile-prefix` to the `configure` command of OCTOPUS:

.. code-block:: sh

  ./configure --with-psolver-prefix=<PSolver-top-dir> --with-futile-prefix=<Futile-top-dir> ... 


The OCTOPUS test `components/16-hartree_3d_psolver.test` is testing the correct functionality of the PSolver library in OCTOPUS.
