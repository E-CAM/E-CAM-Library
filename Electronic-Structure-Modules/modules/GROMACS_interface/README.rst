Purpose of the Module
_________________

This module reads the configurations of a molecular system generated by GROMACS and prepares the input for the GRASP Sampling module. The molecular system must contain a metal ion, that in the module is identified with the variable "metal_atom". The module performs the following operations:

 1. It reads the configurations stored as .gro files in the ./GROMACS_Configurations directory
 2. It calculates, for each configuration, the Euclidean distances of all atoms from the metal ion.
 3. It idenfifies the permutational equivalent atoms  
 4. It performs a Gaussian transformation of the distances
 5. It calculates the variances of transformed distances
 6. It selects the "v_len" coordinates with the higher variances
 7. It prepares the input for the GRASP Sampling module as a matrix N_conf x v_len including the transformed distances for all the configurations stored in the ./GROMACS_Configurations directory.    


Input/Output Structure
______________________

The .gro files must be stored in the ./GROMACS_Configurations directory. The module produces the "selected_coords.txt" file that identifies the v_len coordinates of the output matrix. The output files are: "d_store.txt" the matrix of the distances and "k_store.txt" the matrix of the transformed distances.
 

Source Code
___________

The source code of the algorithm is avaliable from the `E-CAM Gitlab repository`__. It is included in the two files GROMACS_interfaces_1.py and GROMACS_interfaces_2.py. They must be exectuted sequentially: 

::

      $ python3.5 GROMACS_interface_1.py
      $ python3.5 GROMACS_interface_2.py

Testing
_______


To test the module a set of 100 configurations is provided in the ./GROMACS_Configurations directory
