Purpose of Module
___________________

PANNA-GVECT module demonstrates how to efficiently generate Behler-Parinello and modified Behler-Parinello
descriptors (See References 1,2,3). 

These descriptors can then be used in machine learning algorithms. Even though these descriptors were originally designed for 
neural network models, they are equally suitable for other supervised learning schemes such as kernel methods, 
or unsupervised ones such as clustering techniques.

PANNA-GVECT, unlike other modules within the PANNA project, does not use TensorFlow framework. 

Features
__________

PANNA-Gvect supports periodic and aperiodic structures, multiple species, 
derivative of the descriptors with respect to atomic positions.
