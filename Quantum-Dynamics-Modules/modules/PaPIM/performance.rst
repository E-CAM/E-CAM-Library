PaPIM code performance analysis
===============================

Two independent performance analyses of the PaPIM code are reported below. 
They were conducted by Dr. Liang Liang 
(`Maison de la Simulation <http://www.maisondelasimulation.fr/en/index.php?a>`_
and `IDRIS <http://www.idris.fr>`_), and by Dr. Alan O'Cais  
(`JÃ¼lich Supercomputing Center <http://www.fz-juelich.de/ias/jsc/EN/Home/home
\_node.html>`_), respectively. 

A strong scaling analysis of the PaPIM code using the 
`Scalasca <http://www.scalasca.org>`_ analysis tools, and the internal 
PaPIM code calculation time outputs was conducted on the :math:`\text{CH}_{5}^{+}` 
system and performed 
on the `JURECA <http://www.fz-juelich.de/ias/jsc/EN/Expertise/Supercomputers/
JURECA/Configuration/Configuration_node.html>`_ 
cluster at the JSC_. 
:ref:`Figure 1 <fig1>` displays the results of the performed tests.

A parallel efficiency test was made on the `JUQUEEN <http://www.fz-juelich.de/
ias/jsc/EN/Expertise/Supercomputers/JUQUEEN/Configuration/Configuration_node.html>`_ 
cluster at JSC_ also using the :math:`\text{CH}_{5}^{+}` system. 
Results are displayed in :ref:`Figure 2 <fig2>`.

PaPIM scaling performance increases by increasing the number of sampling points. 

Up to date the PaPIM code has been successfully run on 131,072 processor cores at 
JUQUEEN.
