..  In ReStructured Text (ReST) indentation and spacing are very important (it is how ReST knows what to do with your
    document). For ReST to understand what you intend and to render it correctly please to keep the structure of this
    template. Make sure that any time you use ReST syntax (such as for ".. sidebar::" below), it needs to be preceded
    and followed by white space (if you see warnings when this file is built they this is a common origin for problems).

..  We allow the template to be standalone, so that the library maintainers add it in the right place

..  Firstly, let's add technical info as a sidebar and allow text below to wrap around it. This list is a work in
    progress, please help us improve it. We use *definition lists* of ReST_ to make this readable.

..  In the next line you have the name of how this module will be referenced in the main documentation 
..  (which you  can reference, in this case, as ":ref:`example`"). You *MUST* change the reference below 
..  from "example" to something unique otherwise you will cause cross-referencing errors. The reference 
..  must come right before the heading for the reference to work (so don't insert a comment between).

..  Let's add a local table of contents to help people navigate the page

..  contents:: :local:

..  Add an abstract for a *general* audience here. Write a few lines that explains the 
..  "helicopter view" of why you are creating this module. For example, you might say 
..  that "This module is a stepping stone to incorporating XXXX effects into YYYY process, 
..  which in turn should allow ZZZZ to be simulated. If successful, this could make it 
..  possible to produce compound AAAA while avoiding expensive process BBBB and CCCC."

..  The E-CAM library is purely a set of documentation that describes software development 
..  efforts related to the project. A *module* for E-CAM is the documentation of the single 
..  development of effort associated to the project.In that sense, a module does not directly 
..  contain source code but instead contains links to source code, typically stored elsewhere. 
..  Each module references the source code changes to which it directly applies (usually via a URL), 
..  and provides detailed information on the relevant *application* for the changes as well as how 
..  to build and test the associated software.

..  The original source of this page (:download:`readme.rst`) contains lots of additional comments 
..  to help you create your documentation *module* so please use this as a starting point. We use 
..  Sphinx_ (which in turn uses ReST_) to create this documentation. You are free to add any level 
..  of complexity you wish (within the bounds of what Sphinx_ and ReST_ can do). More general 
..  instructions for making your contribution can be found in ":ref:`contributing`".

..  Remember that for a module to be accepted into the E-CAM repository, 
..  your source code changes in the target application
..  must pass a number of acceptance criteria:

..  * Style *(use meaningful variable names, no global variables,...)*

..  * Source code documentation *(each function should be documented with each argument explained)*

..  * Tests *(everything you add should have either unit or regression tests)*

..  * Performance *(If what you introduce has a significant computational load you should make 
..  some performance optimisation effort using an appropriate tool. You should be able to verify
..  that your changes have not introduced unexpected performance penalties, are threadsafe if needed,...)*


Purpose of Module
_________________

..  Keep the helper text below around in your module by just adding "..  " in front of it, 
..  which turns it into a comment

..  Give a brief overview of why the module is/was being created, explaining a little of 
..  the scientific background and how it fits into the larger picture of what you want to achieve. 
..  The overview should be comprehensible to a scientist non-expert in the domain area of the 
..  software module.

..  This section should also include the following (where appropriate):

..  * Who will use the module? in what area(s) and in what context?

..  * What kind of problems can be solved by the code?

..  * Are there any real-world applications for it?

..  * Has the module been interfaced with other packages?

..  * Was it used in a thesis, a scientific collaboration, or was it cited in a publication?

..  * If there are published results obtained using this code, describe them briefly in terms 
..  readable for non-expert users. If you have few pictures/graphs illustrating the power or 
..  utility of the module, please include them with corresponding explanatory captions.


..  If the module is an ingredient for a more general workflow (e.g. the module was the 
..  necessary foundation for later code; the module is part of a group of modules that 
..  will be used to calculate certain property or have certain application, etc.) mention 
..  this, and point to the place where you specify the applications of the more general 
..  workflow (that could be in another module, in another section of this repository, 
..  an applicationâ€™s website, etc.).


..  If you are a post-doc who works in E-CAM, an obvious application for the module 
..  (or for the group of modules that this one is part of) is your pilot project. 
..  In this case, you could point to the pilot project page on the main website 
..  (and you must ensure that this module is linked there).

..  If needed you can include latex mathematics like
.. :math:`\frac{ \sum_{t=0}^{N}f(t,k) }{N}`
..  which won't show up on GitLab/GitHub but will in final online documentation.

..  If you want to add a citation, such as [CIT2009]_, please check the source code 
..  to see how this is done. Note that citations may get rearranged, e.g., to the 
..  bottom of the "page".


The ElVibRot-TID-MPI (ElVibRot time-independent MPI) module is a parallelized 
time-independent quantum simulation program. 
The Davidson algorithm is the main method employed for getting the Eigen levels of the Hamiltonian. 
This module is a part of the `ElVibRot <https://github.com/lauvergn/ElVibRot-TnumTana>`_ package 
designed for general quantum dynamics simulation using curvilinear coordinates. 
The code has no built-in limitation in terms of the number of degrees of freedom. 
It applied a numerical but exact kinetic energy operator with Tnum [Tn1]_, 
which enables much flexibility in the choice of the curvilinear coordinates. 
To avoid the conventional direct-product basis sets and grids, 
the Smolyak algorithm [Sm1]_ is employed to make possible the simulation of larger systems. 


Background Information
______________________

..  Keep the helper text below around in your module by just adding "..  " in front of it, 
..  which turns it into a comment

..  If the modifications are to an existing code base (which is typical) then this would 
..  be the place to name that application. List any relevant urls and explain how to get 
..  access to that code. There needs to be enough information here so that the person 
..  reading knows where to get the source code for the application, what version this 
..  information is relevant for, whether this requires any additional patches/plugins, etc.

..  Overall, this module is supposed to be self-contained, but linking to specific URLs 
..  with more detailed information is encouraged. In other words, the reader should not 
..  need to do a websearch to understand the context of this module, all the links they 
..  need should be already in this module.

The core of the quantum simulation lies in solving the Schrodinger 
equation with the Hamiltonian of the considered system. 
The principle fence of the simulation comes from the exponential growth of computational demand 
with the increasing of the degrees of freedom of the system, the curse of dimensionality. 
It prompts numbers of algorithms in the past decades to deal with this difficulty. 
The Smolyak algorithm, proposed by Smolyak in 1963 [Sm1]_, provides a powerful method 
to deal with high-dimensional problems. 
By introducing the Smolyak algorithm in this module, the wavefunction is expanded as a weighted sum of small  
Smolyak wavefunction contributions, thus significantly reduce the computational demand of the simulation. 
Taking advantage of the structure of the newly transformed wavefunction, the MPI can be well implemented. 
As a result, the simulation could be performed with high accuracy, and in the meantime, 
impressive parallel efficiency. 
The code is designed to works on different levels of clusters. 
The module provides three MPI schemes to adapt the simulation of different kinds of systems and working machines. 
The default setting will automatically choose the scheme according to the balance of resource consumed 
and the parallelization efficiency.  


Applications of the Module
__________________________

This module is intended to provide a parallel program for the quantum simulation of general molecular system. 
Typically, it could be used to calculate the vibrational levels of molecular systems. 
The general capability of the simulation could be up to tens of degrees of freedom. 
The code has been applied for the simulation of Malondialdehyde (:math:`C_3H_4O_2`), 
which is of 21 degrees of freedom. The parallelization of the code enables the simulation of larger systems. 


Building and Testing
____________________

.. Keep the helper text below around in your module by just adding "..  " in front of it, which turns it into a comment

.. Provide the build information for the module here and explain how tests are run. 
.. This needs to be adequately detailed, explaining if necessary any deviations from the 
.. normal build procedure of the application (and links to information
..  about the normal build process needs to be provided).

The code is compatible with ``gfortran``, ``mpifort``, ``ifort``, ``pgf90``, etc. 
Building the program requires OpenMPI v2.0 or above. OpenMPI should be built as 64-bit for 
the simulation of very large system. 

* build with MPI

.. code-block:: bash

  F90=mpifort
  MPICORE=gfortran ! gfortran or ifort according to the compiler for MPI


other main options:

.. code-block:: bash
 
  F90=gfortran    ! compile with gfortran
  F90=ifort       ! compile with ifort
  F90=pgf90       ! compile with pgf90
  parallel_make=1 ! enable parallel make with -j argument
