Purpose of Module
_________________

This module provides exact wavefunction propagation using the second-order differencing (SOD) integrator scheme 
to solve the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation as described by Leforestier et al. [Lef]_ 
Within this scheme the time interval is determined through dividing :math:`\hbar` by the eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian 
operator with the largest absolute value. 

Background Information
______________________

Currently the SOD integration scheme resides within the Quantics_ software package available through CCPForge_.


Testing
_______

A test example (``test90.inp``) is provided for the SOD integration scheme and can be found in the directory 
``~/quantics/elk_inputs``. 
This test works for Quantics_ Revision 787. 
The Quantics_ README file will help you to install the Quantics_ code. 
The test can be done through the following command

::

        $ quantics test90.inp  

A more detailed test documentation for Quantics_ code developers can be found `in this link 
<http://chemb125.chem.ucl.ac.uk/worthgrp/quantics/doc/quantics/elk.html>`_
 

Source Code
___________

.. The source code for the second-order differencing propagator can be found within the Quantics_ software which 
.. can be downloaded via CCPForge_. 
.. You firstly need to make an account (at `CCPForge <https://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/quantics/>`_). 
.. The Quantics_ project has a private repository so you also need to be a member of the project to checkout. 
.. Then type into terminal

.. ::

..        $ svn checkout --username your-user-name https://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/svn/quantics/gmctdh/quantics/trunk/  

The source code for the second-order differencing propagator can be found within the Quantics software which can be downloaded via gitlab_.  You firstly need to make an account (at gitlab). The Quantics project has a private repository so you also need to be a member of the project to clone it into your computer, then type:

 git clone https://gitlab.com/quantics/quantics.git

.. _gitlab: https://gitlab.com/quantics/quantics.git


Within the Quantics_ program, explicit code for the SOD routine is located in file ``~/quantics/source/lib/ode/sodlib.f90``.
